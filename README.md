# A&A Calhoun Automation Consultancy - AI Agent System Examples

## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced AI agent systems designed for retail and healthcare automation, with a strong emphasis on privacy, security, and compliance. The examples showcase how intelligent agents can collaborate while maintaining strict data protection standards.

## Privacy-First Architecture

Our agent system implements a multi-layered privacy approach:

### 1. Structural Privacy Controls
- **Base Agents**: Act as gatekeepers, implementing fundamental security protocols and access controls
- **Coordinator Agents**: Manage workflow distribution while enforcing privacy policies
- **Swarm Coordinators**: Deploy temporary agents for specific privacy-sensitive tasks
- **Privacy Agents**: Dedicated agents that monitor and enforce privacy compliance
- **Location Nodes**: Maintain data locality and geographic privacy boundaries

### 2. Communication Security
- **Isolated Channels**: Agents communicate through dedicated, purpose-specific channels
- **Group Chat Security**: Restricted to authorized agents with appropriate clearance
- **Encrypted Communications**: All inter-agent communications are encrypted
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all agent interactions

### 3. Healthcare-Specific Privacy (HIPAA Compliance)
- **Data Privacy Agents**: Monitor PHI access and enforce HIPAA compliance
- **Audit Agents**: Conduct regular compliance checks
- **Breach Detection**: Real-time monitoring for potential privacy violations
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions for patient data access

### 4. Retail Privacy Features
- **Customer Data Protection**: Dedicated privacy agents for loyalty programs
- **Payment Security**: Specialized agents for payment data handling
- **Marketing Compliance**: Privacy-aware promotional data management
- **Supply Chain Privacy**: Secure handling of vendor and inventory data

   - Performance monitoring
   - Resource allocation

3. **Temporary (Swarm) Agents**
   - Dynamic deployment for specific tasks
   - Automatic cleanup after task completion
   - Minimal privilege access
   - Time-limited operations

4. **Service Agents**
   - Specialized task execution
   - Domain-specific operations
   - Integration with external systems

5. **Location Agents**
   - Geographic-specific operations
   - Local resource management
   - Regional compliance enforcement

### Communication Features
- **Group Chat**: Secure team collaboration
- **Dedicated Channels**: Purpose-specific communication paths
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking
- **Privacy Monitoring**: Real-time compliance checking

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **Visualization**: React Flow for interactive agent network graphs
- **Styling**: 
  - Emotion (MUI's styling solution)
  - Custom CSS-in-JS with dark mode optimization
  - Responsive design patterns

### Agent System
